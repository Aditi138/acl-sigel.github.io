				<h2>SIGEL Elections for 2023-2025</h2> </header>

<p>

<h2>RESULTS OF THE NOMINATION PERIOD:</h2>

<p>The nomination period for the 2023-25 SIGEL Executive Committee,
during Oct. 17 &ndash; Nov. 14, 2022, has closed.

<p>Six elected roles are being filled for a two-year period starting
after January 20, 2023: President, Secretary, and 4 Members-at-Large. We
received one nomination for the Secretary and 3 for (only) the
Member-at-Large positions. Therefore, according to the SIGEL
constitution, they will be declared directly elected to their
positions.

<p>The previous President, Antti Arppe, "shall remain a member of the
Executive Committee for the subsequent term to provide continuity",
according to the SIGEL Constitution.

<p>Two nominations were received for President and an election for
that position will be held (see section below).

<p>The election will be open until January 20, 2023. The results will
be announced by the current President after that time.

<p>If you were a member of SIGEL at the beginning of the Voting
Period, on Nov. 22, 2022, you should
have received an email with the link to the election form.
 

<h2>ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT:</h2>

<p>Two people were nominated both for the role of President and for
the 4th (and last) Member-at-Large position. The Executive Committee
decided to hold an election for both roles simultaneously. The person
with the most votes for SIGEL President will take that position. The
person with fewer votes for President will serve as a Member-at-Large
on the Executive Committee.

<h2>Candidates for President and their candidacy statements</h2>:

<table colspan=3>
  <tr><td><b>Candidate</b></td><td><b>What do you see as one primary concern of SIGEL in the next two years?</b></td><td><b>What is one goal or direction you would like to see SIGEL take over the next two years?</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://sarahrmoeller.github.io/">Sarah Moeller</a> (University of Florida; (computational) linguist)</td><td>Engaging SIGEL community members in the leadership of activities and events, such as the Speaker Series and ComputEL</td><td>Organizing and "field testing" shared activities along the lines of a hackathon that are designed to optimally benefit NLP, linguistics, academia, and community language maintenance efforts</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://dowobeha.github.io/">Lane Schwartz</a> (University of Alaska Fairbanks; (computational) linguist)</td><td>I would like to see SIGEL take the lead within ACL in efforts to educate our peers within ACL on ethical and decolonizing methods in conjunction with NLP work involving Indigenous peoples and Indigenous languages, and the development of a set of ethical guidelines for the ACL community regarding those issues.</td><td>Shared task have been a fantastic mechanism for stimulating progress in many fields within ACL. I would like SIGEL continue to develop a new kind of shared activity based on community-based collaborative processes that could provide education and relationship-building opportunities for those already working with Indigenous languages and for researchers and Indigenous community members who may be just beginning to work in this space.</td></tr>

  <h2>How to vote?</h2>
  
<p>All who were members of SIGEL at the beginning of the Voting
Period, on Nov. 22, 2022, are eligible to vote, and should have

<p>If you were a member of SIGEL on Nov. 22, 2022, and you have NOT
received the email with the link for voting, please contact the
current President, as the presiding officer of these presidential
elections: antti DOT arppe AT iki DOT fi

    <h2>RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</h2>
  
<p>By the end of the Voting period on January 20, 2023, we had
  received 27 votes, of which 17 were cast for Sarah Moeller and 10
  for Lane Schwartz. Consequently, Sarah Moeller was declared elected
  as President of SIGEL, and Lane Schwartz as the fourth
  Member-at-Large on the Executive Committee.
